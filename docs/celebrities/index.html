  <h1>What Celebrities Say About Psychedelics</h1>

<p>
Psychedelics are a class of drugs that bind to the serotonin receptors
in our brains. Their short-term and long-term effects are very similar
based on individual reports.
That's why this page is not limited to psilocybin, a compound found in
some mushrooms. Famous psychedelic drugs beside psilocybin include
LSD, DMT as found in the ayahuasca beverage, and mescaline which is
found in the peyote cactus.
